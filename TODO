Short-Term
1. Refactor storage operations to use Matrix/Vectors, rather than other storages..
2. Change .ptr in container reference types to .addressForNoCopyHack -> hacks should be verbose.
3. Replace swaps with moves in opAssign()-s
4. Implement strided views for PackedSubVector-s
5. Matrix[ i ][ a .. b ] returns slice while Matrix[ a .. b ][ j ] returns view.

Medium Term:
1. Finish writing up operation specializations for all the types (right now only general matrices call BLAS/LAPACK functions for all their opreations).
2. Finish writing LAPACK wrapper functions.
3. Support banded matrices (general, symmetric, and hermitian).

Long term:
1. Merge with dstats.
2. Sparse algebra.
3. Integrate with phobos.
